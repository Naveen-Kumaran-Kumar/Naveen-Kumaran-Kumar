A few things about me:
My nickname is NK. Am a 26-year-young curious learner from India.
Top of mind items presently: How do I play with this data to add value to business! 
A quote I like: “Miles to go before I sleep” – These lines by poet Robert Frost keeps me ticking to learn new things in my day-to-day life

Professional background and interests:
Prior to my master's at Purdue, I was with HSBC for 36 months developing data-driven strategies to increase the recoveries for bank. Operations Analytics has molded me to utilize raw data to get crisp insights-ranging from data crunching to visualization. I worked on projects, ranging from proposing the strategic and tactical changes to co-coordinating the implementation. This helped me to learn how to mobilize with cross-functional teams ranging from operations floor to senior management and aim for collective goals. After undergoing intensive formal training in analytics, am currently exploring opportunities to apply my learnings to make sound business decisions.
